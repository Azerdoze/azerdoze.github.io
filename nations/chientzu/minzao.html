        <h2>Draconic Protectorate of Minzao</h2>
        <img src='../../images/minzao.jpg' alt='minzao Banner'>
        <p>The Minzao are an extremely methodic and practical nation. A great share of the human kingdom's brightest minds comes from here, from philosophers to mathmaticians, biologists, astronomers, etc. They are a nation that likes to show intelectual superiority.</p>
        <p>This country is a very populated nation, if not the most populated in the human kingdom, and the only reason why they don't control the rest of the continent is due to their armies lacking discipline. A technological achievement for them was to invent the crossbow, who anyone can be taught to wield. More importantly though is their mastery over the arcane, something that was almost lost in the human kingdoms and their school of magic is unique. Such mastery made them famous, and feared, for using evokers to bombard enemy lines.</p>
        <p>The inhabitants of the protectorate practice the eastern tradition of the unharmed fighting priests. These warriors, known as warrior monks, are capable of extraordinary feats.</p>
        <p>The minzao protect to extreme lenghts their arcane knowledge. Reserving it solely to citizens of the protectorate. Despite this, they aren't the only nation capable of using arcane arts. They see such foreign practice with immense suspition, and due to the inumerous incidents that happened in the continent's history, they created an international police to combat arcane terror, the Shenmi de Liquan, the Arcane Hounds. These men will investigate any incident that involves magic or something similar, and will cease it as quick as possible.</p>
        <p>Politically formed by big fieves, that inside are divided by smaller ones, and inside of these once again divided into small settlements. Each big fief has a court made by the leaders of the smaller fieves of the region. These leader are, most of the times, sages or academics of the community. Between the members of the courts, Shen Long, the ancient dragon, picks one to be the maximum representative of the region and keep this position for five years.</p>
        <p>Socially, they divide themselves in three classes (academics, military and mob) where there is little flexibility between each other. The academics can marry with military and mob can join the army. This way, the nation secures a lot of manpower. The mob are the artisans and merchants, that drive the economy.</p>
        <p>The minzao worship one being, the dragon Shen Long, and believe in a set of moral codes, that are passed each generation through the elders of the region. Education is seen as something of the utmost importance.</p>
        <p>It's very difficult to enter in the region of Chientzu, the minzao homeland. The territory is surrounded by a network of high walls that protect them from outsiders. They naturally dislike seeing foreigners in their territory. Despite this, they have diplomats in every kingdom.</p>
        <p>The minzao have good diplomatic relations with te muabin, who sell minzao's silks, porcelain and jade throught the Varsemian civilizations. They have bad blood with ulnucs and lao-tse though.</p>
        <p>A minzao is between 1.80m to 2.00m tall. They have dark hair and slanted eyes. Their skin tone is palish, and they like to have long pointy nails and long and thin moustaches and goaties. Their clothes consists of monocolored silk robes.</p>
