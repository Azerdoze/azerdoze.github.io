        <h2>Lao Tse Sun Empire</h2>
        <img src='../../images/laotse.jpg' alt='Lao Tse Banner'>
        <p>The Lao-Tse are one of the most enimagtic humans in Arthan Uthyl. Moved by honor and an conduit of extreme obedience to their superiors. The Lao-Tse worship only one god: Their own emperor.</p>
        <p>The emperor is hereditarily succeeded, but lives way more than a normal human, which turns him into an immortal for human eyes. No one knowns why this happens. The current emperor is Gohzien Tse the IV, the Eternal, and succeeded his antecessor more then a hundred springs ago.</p>
        <p>Directly linked with the emperor's life longevity, the Lao-Tse society lives in a gerontocratic system, thus, the old ones rule.</p>
        <p>There are two great social classes in this society: the samurai and the mob. The samurai are nobles, generals and warlords (daimyos), belonging to powerful clans and holders of some land. They always have a daishyo, which is their nobility symbol and consists of a katana and wakizachi. They follow the code of honor known as the bushido. To be easily recognisable, they usually dress with the color patterns and heraldry of their clan.</p>
        <p>The mob consists of any clanless person, this includes the merchant and artisan castes.</p>
        <p>This society is extremely patriarchical and, as a consequence to this, chauvinist. Women are seen with respect in some roles, like a courtier, but they options and freedom are quite restricted.</p>
        <p>Some women achieve the rare feat of entering the military. For this rare thing to happen, she must be related to a noble and be taught the diverse martial arts and learned the bushido code. A successful woman in this field gets the title of Onna-bugeisha. A great distinction that gives the title holder a place of power in her clan.</p>
        <p>The geography of this nation is divided by clans. Each microregion is governed by a clan. It consists of a numerous, wealthy family of noblemen, with an education above the mob.</p>
        <p>The Lao-Tse are a very disciplined nation. This, allied with good physical resistance and extreme martial tradition makes them a well respected folk in the field of battle. Their weapons are forged with immense precision and their warriors are known to use them in deadly and clinical strokes.</p>
        <p>This nation doesn't fight just with weapons. Known to have a strong unarmed fighting tradition, their most pious warriors reject the use of weapons, treating their fists as a hammer, spear, and blade, with deadly efficiency.</p>
        <p>Just like the Minzao, their rivals, the Lao-Tse also have a tradition of warrior monks and their monks are known for being fearless and powerful in battle.</p>
        <p>The Lao-Tse build their houses, forts and palaces in jagged cliffs, making their cities true wonders of engineering. Their artisans are respected internationally, specially painters and weaponsmiths.</p>
        <p>Economically, they have difficulty living from agriculture, due to the highly unleveled and montainous terrain. Still, their earth is rich in minerals, making the few patches of agriculture quite efficient. They mainly harvest rice, making most of their fields near the Inland Sea, to the East. The margins of the sea is extensively used for fishing, making them one of the nations that most consumes fish in their diet.</p>
        <p>Education is quite strict in this region. Due to its harsh environment, since childhood, everyone is trained to develop a strong will, making them very "do or die" characters. The art of war is omnipresent in their education. The young ones are taught how to manage several weapons, but also how to be good tacticians.</p>
        <p>As hobbies, everyone is encouraged to practice painting and sculpture. This arts are seen as ways of reaching harmony of spirit and balances the heavy warlike discipline.</p>
        <p>Their main rivals are the Minzao and the Ulnuc. They have good relations with the Rubran, Meynari and Kaastians, all of whom they have commercial agreements. They have a mutual alliance with the meynari.</p>
        <p>A Lao-Tse has between 1.60m and 1.80m tall, dark hair, and slanted eyes. Their skin tone goes from bronze to pure white. Noblemen usually have a ponytail tied on top of their head, while mob usually have their hair shaved on the sides. Women are quite vain and use a lot of make-up, flowered clothing and prepped up hair.</p>
