        <h2>Krin Clan Federation</h2>
        <img src='../../images/krin.png' alt='Krin Banner'>
        <p>The Krin are the dominant nation in the area of Istid. They are known for being ferocious warriors, who frequently do raids on the southern and more prosperous regions, where they plunder for riches. They arrive on their long fast boats and spread havok quickly.</p>
        <p>This nation is a warrior nation, stoically defending the North from the threats of the Great Unknown. They live spread out by clans, each governed by a single person, the Jarl, who is always accompanied by the a guard chief, the Housecarl, and a druid.</p>
        <p>Politically, the Kirn live in small clan-states, with each settlement living by their own rules and in an autonomous form. These clan focused settlements aren’t usually big, and are governed by one family, and can shelter up to four or five numerous families.</p>
        <p>There are eight major clans that live in the southern part of the region, where the river Motherflow connects with the Elvhella river. Minor clans and settlements live spread through most of the interior of the region.</p>
        <p>With each clan being autonomous, it’s hard to define a single Krin identity, specially since it’s frequent to see the clans quarrel with each other, with disputes over food supplies, territory or just offenses taken.</p>
        <p>Even with this autonomous rule, all clans still answer to a single person. The best (and sometimes oldest) warrior among the clans, the Fyordheim. Who gets to reside in the fortress of Siebendur. This leader is elected every twenty years through a tournament that unites all the clans together. Besides the Fyordheim there is the Jotun, the master druid, who is handpicked by the Fyordheim.</p>
        <p>Krin education is mostly done by druids, these people teach the young ones the relevance of nature, the influence of the divinities, the art of the hunt and the lesson that a scar carries. Scars are important in Krin society. Someone without scars might be seen as a freshman, or a coward. Someone afraid of battle.</p>
        <p>Young krin develop their martial skils throught hunting and militia service, gaining necessary discipline and coldness with the housecarls.</p>
        <p>Opposite to some societies, the women have an important duty in Krin Society. The housecarl might be the guard chief of the clan, but all families have a household leader, someone responsible for the security of the family, The Skaldmaer, who is always female. It’s frequent to see women fight side by side with men in the battlefield.</p>
        <p>Due to the strong unforgiving presence of nature around them, Krin feel connected to it, being frequent to see druids, hunters and rangers defending their wilder lands. Fighters and Barbarians make the bulk of a Krin army, with their soldiers favouring axes, both in melee and as a throwing weapon.</p>
        <p>While in more developed societies bards have their fare share of trade, Krin bards are exceptional motivators, inciting their kin to fits of rage in the battlefield. These Krin bards are known as Skalds and are a force to be reckoned with.</p>
        <p>Krin worship their own polytheistic pantheon. When a Krin feels his time as come, he embarks on a journey North, passing the lookout points in the edge of the territory and becomes an hermit in the Great Unknown, living there his remaining days. “To die defending the land that I leave to my progeny.” is a common sentence to them that shows well this tradition.</p>
        <p>Krin normally are quite tall, going from 1.80m to 2.10m high. They are strong and robust with rosed or pale skin and usually long and wild blonde hair, with blue or green eyes.</p>
