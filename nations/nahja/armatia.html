        <h2>Holy Kingdom of Armatia</h2>
        <img src='../../images/armatia.png' alt='Armatian Banner'>
        <p>When the Cretian Empire invaded Najha, the Muabin had just finished a war with the Chunoi. With morale running low and resources scattered, the Sand Empire asked for help to the neighboring nations, exchanging knowledge, commerce, cultural and religious freedom, and a lifelong alliance. In the northern side of Nahja, the Armatian tribe, a small territory of religious warriors answered and joined the conflict. With the Muabin tutelage these immensely rich with gold, quickly prospered, developed their society and became a strong and united kingdom.</p>
        <p>The holy kingdom of Armatia is young. Their ruler, Mithridates I, has available an army of pious soldiers. From nomadic origins, these warriors are expert in horseback combat and camel warfare. The coordinated devolopment with the Muabin made them true walking fortresses, covering themselves and their mounts with heavy armor, capable of delivering internationally known charges. These cavaliers are known as Cataphracts. Feared by the fear tactics they employ on the defeated, the best known is bathing the defeated in gold. They believe in the purification of the spirit, so bathing the defeated general in gold cleans their souls of greed and ambition. An Armatian known tactic and achievement is being able to use a bow while riding a horse and with their backs towards the animals' head!</p>
        <p>Focusing on a decentralized government, each sector of the kingdom, known as marezas, has a marzban, a guardian. This entity has all the rights of a king in this sector. Above the Marzban presides the "king of kings", Mithridates I. He rules the kingdom in a more abstract way, being responsible for international duty, like diplomacy, commerce and managing the armies. Like the leader before him, he has a polygamous relationship, marrying women from different kingdoms to guaranty an alliance.</p>
        <p>The armatian society is an open one, with it's doors available for several religions. Albeit, the predominant one is the monotheistic religion of Zistranism, the cult of Zistra, which is a local religion. They are also fascinated by other cultures, specially lampa, and they frequently invite artists from these cultures.</p>
        <p>Commercially, the kingdom of Armatia is known to impose taxes on eastern caravans that go towards the rich markets of Varsemia. Particularly, the Minzao empire use the armatian territory to cross their silk and pearl caravans safely to the West. The armatians, besides gold, have a healthy industry of spices, perfumes and a strong agriculture, where they export fruits produced in the region.</p>
        <p>Due to their beliefs, armatians abhor slavery and teach the teachings of Zistra to everyone who's interested. Zistra's Priests, known as magi, are encoraged to be present in the courts of the armatian kings, where they hold functions like alchemists, physicians and astrologers.</p>
        <p>The armatians have a very unique architecture in Najha, resulting in the fusion of the lampa and muabin cultures. They build their structures in marble, using ivory for the details, with the end becoming something very exotic for Najha standards.</p>
        <p>Out of combat, the noble armatians usually wear a gibon and a tunic in a V shaped. Loose but tied up by a belt, with loose pants and a diadem above the hair,  carefully combed and cut. Most of the population uses the traditional shirt (qamis), made of delicate and ornamental materials. Women wear mantles with long sleeves above a dress, with necklaces, earings, bracelets and headwear covered by jewels. Their dresses are hold together by a pin in the sholders.</p>
        <p>The Armatian Banner is made of two condors looking towards a star, between them, all painted in brown. With a background in a dark green.</p>
        <p>They belong to the Muabin culture. They have a permanent alliance with them and are currently involved in the War of Northern Nahja, that puts them and their allies against the forces of the Cretian Empire, Zancium and Sephs.</p>
        <p>A typical armatian heights between 1.60m to 1.80m tall. Their men are usually strong, due to the training to withstand the heavy armors. They have bronze skins, dark hair and dark or green eyes.</p>
