        <h1>Arthan Uthyl</h1>
        <p>A Pathfinder Campaign Setting</p>
    </div>
    <div class="About">
        <h2>Quetza</h2>
        
        <p>In the lush jungles of Quetza there once existed a xenophobic, cruel empire. Isolated from the rest of the human kingdoms for millenia. The Quepa-Qual was known through all the continent as a vast empire of pernicious humans that used their prisoners not only in savage games of survival, but also in mass sacrifices to  gods, on top of their blood covered pyramids.</p>
        <p>The empire was feared, not just by their size and strength, but also for their cunning and tenacity. Such an empire lived untouched and unscathed from outside influences since it's foundation, somewhere during the Age of Arrivals. All that changed with the Great Deluge.</p>
        <p>The Great Deluge shook the empire's core to it's deepest and with unforeseen consequences. The floods and the earthquakes brought hunger and plague that desolated the quetzan territory. Tens of thousands of people died in plain streets of the empires biggest cities. The capital, Zapotecla, saw part of it being swallowed by the river Nekh'Phal. A scar of those times for eternity.</p>
        <p>The moral of the citizens was engulfed in flames and the low class and military finally burst against the noble hierarchy, thus beginning the War of the Triangle, also known as the Quetzan Civil War, disputed, as the name implies, by three fronts.</p>
        <p>As time passed by, and the war dragging itself, the once united Empire was no more and three nations rose up from it's ashes. Young nations of old blood, thirsty to carve their name into the world and bring once again glory to Quetza.</p>
        <p>These nations, of Quepatec culture, share most of the old empire's traits. The new nations work around these massive city-states, true metropolis (altepetl), and their surroundings (calpulli). The leader of each nation is known as the Calpuleh.</p>
        <p>In society, they are divided into nobles (pipiltin) and common folk (macehualtin) and insde theses there is an elaborate hierarchy of social status, responsabilities and power. Interesting fact is that any common folk can achieve through merit to a lower noble position. a long distance merchant (pochtecah) is a good example of this. Their economy is based on agriculture, pillage, and commerce, now finally open to the rest of the human nations, and their mining of gold and marble. Each nation specialized itself on a different craft.</p>
        <p>Education is mandatory to everyone until their fifteenth summer, taugh by their parents and the local priest. The next five summers, young ones go to two different schools: Telpochcalli, the House of Young Ones, where they are taught history, religion, combat, commerce and craft. And Calmelac, the House of Knowledge, dedicated to noble teens. Here they are molded into leaders (tlatoque), priests and scholars (tlatimini), healers (tizitl) and judges (tlacuilos), with areas covering calligraphy, astronomy, administration, theology among others.</p>
        <p>A polytheistic culture with their own pantheon, priests and scholars are seen with utmost respect and take a very strict life: cold baths in the morning, intense physical training, resistance tests, and self-flagellation produce an extremely stoic social class.</p>
        <p>Even though these hard folk still have a conservative society, they are determined to clean their image to the rest of the continent.</p>
        <p>In battle, each new nation of Quetza has their own tactics, but all are strong with the atlatl, a mechanism to throw dards and javelins longer, and the maquahuitl, a serrated thick sword, usually made of wood, stone, or both.</p>
        <p>An average citizen of Quepatec culture has between 1.50m and 1.80m. Possesses tanned skin, dark hair and usually big dark eyes. They wear facial adornments, like nasal bones, earings, lip spikes, among others, and almost always have facial paint or tattoos with intense colours.</p>
