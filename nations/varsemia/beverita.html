        <h2>Beveritan Confederative States</h2>
        <img src='../../images/beverita.png' alt='Beveritan Banner'>
        <p>In the north west of Varsemia, a group of different nations with the same culture joined a complex alliance system.</p>
        <p>Formerly tribal men with strong society values, these folk, known as beveritan, have evolved enough so that each nation became unique on it's own.</p>
        <p>Besides the strong alliances that make this independent states united, this cultural group can be subdivided into four smaller cultural groups. The Continental, Insular, Peninsular and Eastern.</p>
        <p>The Avenai, Buori and Noeri are the "continental beveritans". They are usually tall, strong, posessing light colored hair and eyes. These nations governments are republics.</p>
        <p>the "insular beveritans" live in the Island of Name, in Lake Widowlore. They are made of Bertians and Pieni. Bertians live on the bottom half while Pieni on the upper half. They are seen as the palest of the beveritans. Each of these nations is governed through a Monarchy.</p>
        <p>The Keltirian and Galitian make the "peninsular beveritans". They reside on the Tarhcan Peninsula, with Galitians living on the northern part and Keltirians on the southern. They have dark hair and dark eyes, and they live in citadel-states, on top of hills.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the Eastari make the "eastern beveritans". They live on the eastern part of rocky desert of Lapidibus Agri. They have a rosed skin and light blue eyes, and are governed through cantons, or subregional management.</p>
        <p>A typical beveritan heights between 1,70m to 2,00m, and likes to have her hair braided.</p>
        
        <h3>Avenai</h3>
        
        <p>The Avenai live in the cities of Bibracte, Gergovia and Alesia, and it's surroundings.</p>
        <p>They are seen as prized metalworkers throughout the land, supplying most of the confederation and booming their local economy, thus it's citizens are considered wealthy for beveritan standards.</p>
        <p>The Avenai also are a strong diplomatic force, not only in the confederation, but also in the continent, thought they have a harder time interacting with tribals.</p>
        <p>The boar is sacred to this nation. These animals grow to considerable size and are sturdier than average, making the Avenai fond of using these animals as good companions, even as mounts. </p>
        <p>Military wise, they are known for their heavy spearmen. Trained since youth, the folk of Avena master the art of spear fighting until they become deadly combatatants.</p>
        <p>Their current republican leader is a charismatic and cunning warrior named Vergincorix.</p>
        
        <h3>Buori</h3>
        
        <p>The cities of Telamon, Placentia and Mutina, and it's surroundings make the land of the Buori.</p>
        <p>they are governed in their republic by a strong, passionate warrior called Bellovesus.</p>
        <p>This nation is known for it's less noble practices and thus seen badly between other beveritan nations.</p>
        <p>The fact that they are known raiders, plundering both nearby and distant realms, and also by the fact they attack in considerable numbers, makes their ill-reputation just. Not only this, but their warrior society praises to fight naked in battle, which intimidates even more their foes.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the folk of Buor are known as skilled herders, praising above all their aurochs. These animals are quite useful in their society and Buori see them as sacred, even charging to war with them.</p>
        <p>Due to their more barbaric ways, the Buori have an oral education system, thus most of it's inhabitants are illiterate.</p>
        
        <h3>Noeri</h3>
        
        <p>In the lands of the cities of Bagacum, Fanum Martis, and Gemimniacum, live the Noeri.</p>
        <p>This nation is governed through a republic by a zealous and pious man known as Boduognatus.</p>
        <p>The Noeri are known for being extreme in their ways. They live on a very strict code of conduit, the Noeri Way, which makes them forfeit most luxuries and despise any type of commerce. Thus, they live in a community way.</p>
        <p>Their Warriors are known for being fearless and unrelenting, capable of continuing against the face of danger for large amounts of time. That and when the summons are made, their armies swarm the battlefield, making them a respectable force.</p>
        <p>Even with their codes and laws, Noeri are still barbaric, with a oral education system, making most of it's denizens illiterate.</p>
        <p>They have the particularity of producing excellent skalds, or savage bards. These performers master the art of the horn blowing and are known to bolster the zealous warriors morale to impressive heights.</p>
        
        <h3>Bertians</h3>
        
        <p>In the southern side of the Island of Name, exists the Kingdom of Bertia, emcompassing all the bottom half of the island and it's three cities Gwynedd, Venta Icenorum and Eboracum.</p>
        <p>Each of the it's cities is autonomous, with a ruler responsible for each city. The strategist and morally right Lucius Castus governs Eboracum. The proud and rancorous Boudicea rules Venta Icenorum, and Cadwallon, a conservative, but wise man, is in charge of Gwynedd.</p>
        <p>The bertians are known for their chivalric lifestyle. Always trying to behave nobly and respectfully, even to the ones they might despise. They are also fond of jousting and court life.</p>
        <p>Contrary to most other beveritans, they don't worship beveritan gods. Instead, they worship Druidism, seeing druids and their mysterious ways as guides of the threads of fate. They also see the elk as a holy creature.</p>
        <p>Bertians are expert farmers, knowing full well how to exploit a fertile land. Not only that, but due to higher education they are as good diplomats as the Avenai.</p>
        <p>In battle, they swarm the fields with heavy cavalry, the best on the confederation, charging their enemy with fearsome war elks to devastating effect.</p>
        
        <h3>Pieni</h3>
        
        <p>In the northern side of the Island of Name, encompassing the cities of Circinn, Fotla and Fortriu, live tribal Pieni.</p>
        <p>Each city is ruled by a monarch. A giant of a man, Drest, son of Erp, rules Circinn. the city of Fotla is in charge of Nechtan "The Great" Celcamoth, a surprisingly small, but fierce leader. The city of Fortriu is overseen by Gartnait II, a stocky and fat genius.</p>
        <p>The Pieni are the main ambushers of the beveritan force. They are experts in studying the area and employing fear tactics to gain the upper hand against their foes.</p>
        <p>They charge their enemies with abbadon, running naked from their hideout, their bodies covered in blue and white paint, making a disturbing visage for their unfortunate enemies.</p>
        <p>The Pieni are also well known bounty hunters. With a peculiar skill of being deadly with slashing weapons.</p>
        <p>Since they have an oral education, most of it's citizens are illiterate.</p>
        
        <h3>Keltirian</h3>
        
        <p>Deep in the southern side of the Tarhcan Peninsula resides the micro kingdom of Keltiria. This small reign is made of three cities (Kontebakom-Bel, Sekaisa and Okilis) and its surrounding lands, with Okilis as it's capital.</p>
        <p>They are governed by a cunning and old warrior king named Carus. Carus was initially from a city called Segeda, though that city was razed many years ago. Nonetheless people still call him Carus of Segeda.</p>
        <p>The Keltirians are known for their shrewd diplomatic skills with their more isolated neighbours, the Galitian.</p>
        <p>In warfare, these warriors are master ambushers and can navigate easily through mountainous terrain. They are master throwers, specialized in Javelin throwing.</p>
        <p>With rocky landscapes as home, these proud people became adept and skilled in animal husbandry, and they are known to train deadly bulls for war.</p>
        <p>Like most beveritans, they have an oral tradition, thus most of the population is illiterate.</p>
