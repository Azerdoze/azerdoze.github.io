        <h2>Varsemian Isles Confederative League</h2>
        <p>The South of Varsemia once belonged to a kingdom of stoic and determined warriors, created since childhood to be the perfect war machines. A kingdom, that even when the Great Deluge came and turned their lust lands into scattered isles, they stood strong and united. Even when the Cretian Empire started their expansionism, The kingdom stood tall. Even outnumbered, they managed to defend their land from the invaders. That is, until the Battle of Spiti, where, even after being victorious, the Lampa king Pirhus fell in battle.</p>
        <p>With the fall of the king and without successor to the throne, the old Lampa Kingdom saw itself without a leader to guide it. Thus, it was decided by the various political parties to create a reunion between the leaders of the archipelagos major cities. Akeros, Corkos, Thebae, Santea e Lamporia. Here it was agreed that the old kingdom would be divided by the different isles, with the loyalists to the old kingdom staying in the isle of Lamporia. Thus the Isle Nations of Makeronia, Corkosia, Santea and Thebae. Most recently a new city-state was formed on the Varsemian Peninsula, Bacinia, and added to the confederation.</p>
        <p>A typical citizen from the Isle Nations of Varsemia is between 1,60m to 1,90m tall. They usually have a well defined body, due to harsh and continuous training. They have bronze skin due to the embraced life by the sea. Their haiir is usually long and braided and it’s frequent to have thick and braided beards. They eyes are dark, though there are rare exceptions.</p>
        <p>The isles have a stratified society, which is divided into various social classes: Pathes, citizens with local parents, that have full rights; Mathakes, people created by locals; Periokoi, free people; Helots, people that are slaves, servants, etc.</p>

        <p>The reformed Lampa kingdom, now officially Lamporian City-State, is situated in the isle of the same name. It’s a shadow of it’s glorious past. Still, they stand proud and with the same stoic beliefs. These folk live in a diarchy, where two people govern as rulers, each from a different family, but having equal power. The responsibilities of these rulers are fundamentally religious and military, with them working above all as generals.</p>
        <p>The judicial power resides on a group of oficials called Ephors and a counsil of elders, known as Gerousia. This council is made of twenty eight elders older then sixty springs. They are elect for life and they are usually of royal blood. It’s up to them, between many decisions,  for the country to participate or not in wars.</p>
        <p>A nation that aspires for physical perfection above mental acuity, they are known for sacrificing their deformed or not healthy babies, thus trying to keep the strongest population possible.</p>
        <p>The women have an important and active role in Lamporian Society. They are viewed as an equal to men and have access to a strong education, most able to write, read and count. The Lamporian women can’t marry early, only after twenty winters. This is to assure that she is strong and healthy during labor, thus producing healthy children. Women are the ones that control most of the economical power. They don’t have the right to wage or go to war, but they deal and manage the territories and local commerce.</p>
        <p>Known by their art of war, these men specialize on the clinical and lethal use of spear and shield. One line of Lamporian Hoplites is known to be unbreakable. The normal outfit of a warrior is a closed helmet, a light or medium armor, usually a breastplate, a bunch of javelins, a spear, a round metal shield, a falcata and a red cape to help against rough climate.</p>
        <p>An extremely religious nation, these have a group of priests that have special power in Lamporian society, the Oracles. These are strong female mystics whose strong divine magic allows them to see or predict the best course of action. The Lamporians worship above everything gods of war and procreation and they practice sacrifices honoring these gods before important events, like war. Their patron god is Ahres.</p>

        <p>Between the isles that form the Corkosian League lies the isle of Cyzica, where the Tebean Oligarchic City State, or Tebea for short, is established. Their current ruler, Epaminondas, is an efficient general and statesman.</p>
        <p>Tebean economy is predominantly agricultural. It’s denizens like the contact of nature and preserve the isle of being overly exploited. Thus, Cyzica is a natural wonder with amazing sight seeing places to visit. Not as prosperous or of political importance as Lamporia or Santea, nonetheless Tebean has a strong economy, with it’s grain fields feeding a part of the archipelago.</p>
        <p>Diplomatically, Tebean have been known to have dubious choices of alliances. They’ve allied several times with the Muab and Sephs when it suited them, angering the rest of the archipelago. Also, Tebean used to be the head of the Corkosian League, but the alliance shifting made them lose that seat of power. Sworn rivals of Santea, who they see as a society going too astray from the natural wonder of mankind, skirmishes between both are frequent. Even so, Tebean put their differences aside and joined the Isles Confederation against the overwhelming power of the rising Cretian Empire. Being an effective ally during the war.</p>
        <p>Military wise, these folk are proud fighters that know how to read the battlefield. Their warriors are resilient and agile and their expertise with blunt weapons is well known. They have a highly prestiged group of warriors called the Sacred Band of Tebea. This group consists of one hundred and fifty pairs of male lovers that form the elite force of the Tebean army and are led by the general and statesman Pelopidas. These elite warriors are legendary with slings. Last but not least, Their military is known to employ the use of big felines, where Lions and Leopards are trained since cubs to be effective partners at war.</p>
        <p>Tebean religion is focused on the gods of farming and hunt, with their patron god being Artemiza.</p>

        <h3><b>Baciria</b></h3>
        <img src='../../images/baciria.png' alt='Bacirian Banner'>
        
        <p>After the successful campaign against the Cretian Empire, that made the Confederate Island States take control of the peninsula, soon that strategic land grew quickly, people from all over the human kingdoms were enticed by the prospect of a thriving new hub, a land of new opportunities. The old fort of Kerkyra quickly became an important crossroad between western and eastern kingdoms. The villages of Edisea and Corinea, once just normal fishing towns, saw their harbours become filled with boats coming from everywhere bringing exotic goods and trade. The freedom of movement, even for their former enemies, saw multiculturalism and free religion prosper, as more and more denizens of the kingdoms seeked to make a new life there.</p>
        <p>Soon, the bursting new society saw the inevitable, they had become too big to be just small territory controlled overseas. In a politically mastered coup that saw no blood spilled, the lords of the peninsula took complete control and installed the leader of Kerkyra, Diodocus, as their monarch. This coup was badly seen with the Isles Confederation, who saw the region as important economically, still they couldn’t face it against the overwhelming support Diodocus gathered.</p>
        <p>Diodocus first order was to rename the citadel of Kerkyra to Baciria, thus the City-State of Baciria was born.</p>
        <p>Bacirians are an interesting breed. They are a mix society with the fundamentals of the Lamporian culture still intact, but the contact and exposition to other cultures, specially eastern ones, developed something unique. Aesthetically, their cities are still very lamporian, but it’s denizens have more meynari descendants than any other nation. This multiculturalism led to free religion, something rare in the human kingdoms. Not only that, but this cultural pot made them become curious about the world and they quickly adopted tactics and training to make them better and scouting terrain, thus making this nation good wayfarers.</p>
        <p>Bacirian military reflects this multiculturalism. Their infantry is composed by finely trained and disciplined hoplites, martial heritage from the Islands Confederation. Their cavalry was trained by mercenary chunoi and ulnucs who taught them the fine skill of horseback archery. Also, their cavalry, with Meynari and Nahjian influences, managed to domesticate and employ as cohorts and mounts more exotic animals, like Elephants and Rhinos. To finalize this exotic mix of cavalry units is the introduction of a new breed of camels, the Bacirian Camels. These are bulkier and more resistant than their cousins, with strong fur that protects them from harsh environments. These animals are used to cross difficult terrain, making them ideal for the Bacirian caravans to go to Far East to trade goods.</p>
        <p>While a typical Bacirian has the traditional lamporian genetic traits they have adopted an Eastern sense of fashion. Their eyes are usually eyelined, they use long turbans to cover most of their faces and they use a mixture of eastern and western weaponry.</p>
