        <h2>Cretian Empire of the North</h2>
        <img src='../../images/cretus.jpg' alt='Cretian Banner'>
        <p>In the Eastern side of Varsemia lies a power hungry empire. Naturally ambitious, these nation is almost always plotting expansions, trying to subjugate their enemies and making workforce of their fallen foes.</p>
        <p>The Empire of Cretus, or simply cretians, are quite the nation. Diplomatically very agressive and with a strong urge for conquer. Their government is managed by an elite, called the Senate, and the Caesar, choosen by the elite to function as an emperor. The Senate controls the juridical power, while Caesar controls the military. The economy is free in Cretus. Because of that, the wealthier tend to control a big part of the economy, making alliances and building an intricate monopoly.</p>
        <p>Justice in the human kingdoms originated here, in Cretus, and their juridical system is one of the most complete and advanced in the whole continent. The laws, lex in cretian, are kept behind the walls of huge buildings, called Curiae, where citizens are also judged (by jurisconsultus) for crimes inside the empire's territory. Justice is kept in the streets by the Pretoriani. Soldiers highly skilled and trained, that answer directly to the emperor and make sure that the Lex is respected. The highest punishment in the empire is death by crucification.</p>
        <p>The Cretians have a well organised military, with a lot of the tactics and military concepts coming from the minds of cretian strategists. It's a nation known for their intricate and perfectionist organization of their military and all citizens of the empire are forced to do ten years in the army. Their armies use banners with a golden eagle, it's wings wide open. Their troops use armors mostly composed of metal straps, red garbs, a big rectangular shield, a gladius, a dagger and two dards, to throw at their enemies before they charge at them.</p>
        <p>Religion is to the cretians a complicated matter. the Caesar decides which is the official religion of the empire, but since they are almost always trying to conquer territory, it leads to a lot of different religions inside their territory. This leads to a lot of quarrels by fanatics or xenophobes, which are quenched by mass crucifications. The cretians by default have their own pantheon and massive temples can be found throughout their territory.</p>
        <p>Well known for their oppressive instincts, the cretians are famous for their harshness towards the conquered. From crucifications to imposing their beliefs and religion, they have become infamous for their xenophoby. Truth be told, they try to convince the conquered of the cultural and juridical advantages of the "cretianization", making those that adapt free citizens of the empire. With this method, they ensure the empire keeps itself culturally strong.</p>
        <p>Diplomatically, Cretus has good relations with the Lampa states. They have healthy commercial ties with the Kaastians and they currently have an alliance through marriage with the Sephs. Their coat of arms is a golden eagle, itÂºs wings wide open, inside a white globe, with a red background.</p>
        <p>Cretian citizens have controversial leisure habits. The abuse of slavery, not just for households, but also to fight in massive arenas is just the tip of the iceberg. Orgies are common throughout the rich and pedophilia is seen as an accepted practice. These make some nations see them as an excessive and corrupt way of living.</p>
        <p>A typical cretian has between 1.60m and 1.80m of height. They usually have dark and short hair and clean shaved. Their eyes match their hair. A citizen in it's daily life does not wear much more than a toga and some sandals.</p>
