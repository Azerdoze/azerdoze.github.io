        <p>A Pathfinder Campaign Setting</p>

    <div class="About">
        <h2>Kaastian Mercantile Republic</h2>
        <p>In the region of West Varsemia, near the Nakolotan border, the Kaasts live. A nation that inhabits in a network of canals and rivers, prospering and dominating the continent's commerce.</p>
        <p>The Kaasts are a diverse nation with focus on trade, doing business often with most of the nations. Currency was added in the continent by them and the various gold deposits, scattered throught the region, helped them become a strong power in the human kingdoms.</p>
        <p>This nation is ruled by an oligarchic counsil known as "Vermogend". This is made of ten people, each one a representative, a duke, of each of the most wealthy families in the nation. They discuss politics and commerce. Alas, This counsil works more as a symbol of power, making laws for the nations economical well being and not much else. The true power is in the families. Each family controls parcels of the cities, having complete jurisdiction inside these. The streets are patrolled by family owned guards and the kaastian army is no more than mercenary companies employed by wealthy merchants.</p>
        <p>In a society where the reach hold most of the power, the families fight and conspire between them, constantly searching for ways of weakening their rivals, in a unending game of intrigue and power. Their courts are avid of intrigue and conspiracy and their spies infamous throught all the land. Life in the court for a kaastian is very important and the kaasts believe that whoever holds the most knowledge, is the most powerful. And with the wealth generated by the commerce, the different houses are always trying to get the upper part of the deal in a neverending spyonage battle.</p>
        <p>The art of Gunpowder, stolen from the Muab, has long since been perfected by their engineers and academics and these "River Foxes" (how they are known throught the region) developed their firearms way smaller then the Muab Muskets. Today, these weapons, pistols, are part of the equipment of any soldier of spy.</p>
        <p>Military wise, the Kaasts prefer freedom of movement and coordination. Using practical light armor in battle. A typical kaastian soldier doesn't use more than a studded leather or a simple breastplate, an halberd, a rapier, two pistols and a pouch with ammunition.</p>
        <p>Religiously, this nation worships one entity, "The One God", Klaar. They see this being as a savior and redemptor of their people. In his temples, the poor are sheltered and taught. their priests spread the word and faith by the remaining kingdoms and it's frequent to see Klaar missionaries in other regions. The dukes themselves, family leaders, are zealous worshipers and work obsessively for the divine favour of their god.</p>
        <p>Due to the nations high commercial capacity, the kaasts harbour plenty of iluminated people from all the continent, from diverse cultural fields. Each court with a wide range of sages from different origins, training and improving the minds of their hired family, pushing for perfection the knowledge of the houses. This makes the Kaasts, specially the richest houses, some of the most culturally advanced in all the continent.</p>
        <p>Master of commerce, they keep wonderful diplomatic (and economical) relations with the Rubran, and good relationships in general with the rest of the nations in Varsemia. The canals and rivers that they dominate are stratigically good for, if the need arises, to stablish commercial deals with remote regions. Thus, there are commercial outposts positioned cleverly throught most of the continent, strengthning a house's power in the region. Nakolota is a good example of this. The kaastians are currently trying to explore the regions resources, much to the locals anger.</p>
        <p>A typical kaastian measures between 1,70m to 2,10m tall. They are usually tall and slim, with hair normally light coloured, from light brown to pure blonde, using short hairstyles but extravagant and well groomed facial hairstyles. Their eyes are likewise light. They like to wear the colours that represent their houses.</p>
