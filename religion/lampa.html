        <h2>Lampa Pantheon</h2>
        <p>The Lampa pantheon is polytheistic, with nine main deities and each one representing an alignment. Their story revolves around how three brothers united to dethrone their parents.</p>
        <p>---</p>
        <p>The pantheon leader is <b>Zuss</b>. One of the three sons, he plotted with his siblings and usurped the throne. Described has a well built man, with long white hair and beard, usually dressed with a simple white mantle and frequently carrying holding lightning bolts, his weapon of choice.</p>

        <p>Followers of Zuss are stoic characters, determined, who do not fear death to reach their objectives and believe that sacrifice can be done for the greater good. They are usually dressed with a white mantle on top of their armor (if any) and their long beards. Such clerics often can be found in the biggest temples in Lampa culture and belong to the high society. Zuss religious symbol is a lightning bolt in blue.</p>
        <p>---</p>

        <p>---</p>
        <p>The goddess of the hunt, protector of the forests, the moon governess and saint of the fletchery, <b>Artemiza</b> is the chosen Goddess for those who prefer to live a life away from the city and more near nature.</p>
        <p>She is Zuss' Wife and is described as a stunning woman, using a practical green outfit, with long dark hair and long feathered wings, always with her trusted bow in hand. Her alignment is Chaotic Good and her weapon of choice is the shortbow.</p>

They are seen mostly outside of cities, where they can be closer to nature and temples dedicated to her are usually amidst forests. Most devouts of Artemiza are rangers, druids or a class focused on nature. Her holy symbol is a bow and arrow.</p>
        <p>---</p>
        <p><b>Poisodin</b> is Zuss' older brother. He is described has an half man half octopus, with long beards, filled with algae, corals and other maritime motifs. He wears a coral crown showing his supremacy of the oceans. He is known as the supreme ruler of the seas, the stormbringer, bringer of calamity. A force to be reckoned with, he is Lawful Neutral and his favoured weapon is the Trident.</p>

They are seen has tempestuous and impatient characters, usually prefering the coastline, where they build temples for their Lord. They enjoy helping sailors, fishermen and other maritime jobs. Poisodin's holy symbol is a trident in front of a wave.</p>
        <p>---</p>
        <p><b>Hefastos</b> is Poisodin's son. He is a man with dark skin and ginger hair, usually employing a hammer with a chain. He is usually depicted has wearing legs and arms armor. He is known as a calm and meditative lord.</p>
        <p>He is the God of fire, patron of rock and metal and guardian of forges, thus he is the favoured god of artisans and smiths. His alignment is True Neutral and his weapon of choice is the Hammer and Chain.</p>
        <p>People that follow Hefastos dress up in bronze colors. Normally, due to the heat of the forges, they have reddish tones in their hair and are seen in industrious places. His holy symbol is an anvil with a bronze hammer.</p>
        <p>---</p>
        <p>Hefastos' son is the perfect warrior, <b>Ahris</b>. He is described has a warrior with perfect physical condition, fully equipped for war, with a glaive as a weapon and a round shield on the other hand and using a red cloak resting on top of his bronze breastplate. From inside his helmet, his bright red eyes can be seen.</p>
        <p>Ahris is the god of strength and war. Anyone in the military worships Ahris to some degree. His alignment is Chaotic Neutral and his weapon of choice is the Glaive.</p>
        <p>Ahris' Priests use a bronze armor set and red cloaks. Their helmets usually have red motifs. They are usually found in the military, even accompanying armies to war, inspiring nearby soldiers in battle and promising inglorious death to all those who oppose Ahris' might and the Lampa culture. His temples are on top of hills or near military complexes. His holy symbol is a round shield with a helmet in the centre.</p>
        <p>---</p>
        <p>The younger of the siblings is <b>Ghadis</b>. He was the one that orchestrated the plot to overthrow their parents throne. Ghadis is described has a man in dark clothes that meld in shadows. His hair and beard pitch black contrasting with his ashen coloured skin and his golden eyes.</p>
        <p>He is the ruler of the underworld, leader and protector of the dead and symbol of the mortal greed.</p>
        <p>His disciples usually are guardians of necropolis and mausoleums. His aligment is Lawful Evil and his weapon of choice is the Flying Blade.</p>
        <p>His worshippers love wearing black robes. Usually reserved people, arrogant and  greedy, they aren't no fools, though and are in fact known to be extreme manipulators. They are found mostly defending burial sites, where Ghadis temples can also be found. His holy symbol is a a cross with a half open circle on top and a closed circle inside of this one. </p>
        <p>---</p>
        <p>When the three brothers dethroned their parents, and the older pantheon, two gods were too dark and sinister, their force even frightening the new rulers. These two old primordials thus resist the test of time and are still worshipped in Lampa culture.</p>
        <p>One of those gods is <b>Thanakos</b>. He is a primordial being that represents death, night and the inevitable. He is described has a shadow dressed in black robes and a scythe, ready to reap and colect the souls of those ready to depart the mortal realms. He is worshipped by Ghadis followers but also by those few who adore death. His alignment is Neutral Evil and his Favored Weapon is a Scythe.</p>
        <p>Those that worship Thanakos are either acknowledge by Ghadis priests and responsible for bringing in the recently departed to the Lampa necropolis or are people that worship him secretly. Normally they are cold, simple, fatalists, often mingling with Ghadis devouts. His holy symbol in a scythe around a skull.</p>
        <p>---</p>
        <p>From the darkest depths of the mortal realm or maybe even from a realm beyond it, the three brothers couldn't do much against the physical representation of devastation known as <b>Typhos</b>. The best the brothers could do was keeping it where no mortal could ever reach. Typhos is father and absolute ruler of all monsters, the lord of nightmares, the apocalypse bringer. His name is synonym of tragedy and misfortune, his will capable of corrupting the weaker minds and transforming wicked men into monsters. Merely thinking of Typhos gives him strength, so his worship is heavily forbidden. His alignment is Chaotic Evil and his weapon of choice is the Warpick.</p>
        <p>Cultists of Typhos are rarely organized. Wanted by local and international authorities, they are seen not just as terrorists but enemies of humankind. They hide everywhere and gather in the most inhospitable places. These devouts when successful give birth to true abominations that put society's welfare at risk. Various international orders actively fight Typhos cult. His holy symbol is a couple of white fangs with wiggling black tentacles.</p>
