        <h2>Barcagenian Gerontocratic Republic</h2>
        <img src='../../images/barcago.png' alt='Barcagenian Banner'>
        <p>When the rubran fell to the cretian armies, the prestigious Barcagid family fled to Najha, swearing vengeance. Seizing the seas created by the Great Deluge, they stablished themselves in the southern coast of Najha and it's archipelago. The family quickly began to shelter war refugees, giving them a new life, and with this, they grew as a nation. With years passing by, they became a bulwark of resistance and a prestigious nation, rivaling the cretian empire. Thus, the Barcagenian nation was born, made of collective society who's goal is to end the Cretian imperiliasm.</p>
        <p>The barcagenians are governed by a gerontocratic republic, a selected council of elders elected every year by the diverse barcagenans houses. On the daily basis, the districts of Barcago, the capital, and other small cities are usually led by one or more oligarchs. These currently leave their armies in the hands of one of the most feared and respected general of the era, Anibal Barcagid. The barcagenians are lords of the seas of Najha and Varsemia, sharing this maritime supremacy with the Confederate City-States of the Varsemian Isles. But, while the later gambled on a merchant focused fleet, Barcagenia has a more homogenous fleet, being well prepared for naval warfare.</p>
        <p>With a strong and sustainable economy, focusing on a vast piscatorial economy and a effective maritime commerce. The barcagenians have a strong trade, relying on their allies, from where they acquire vast quantities of silver, lead, copper e - most important of all - tin, which is used in the majority of the objects in Najha. With a powerful trade allied with a naval fleet capable of envying most nations in the human kingdoms, they garantee the monopoly of this resource in the seas. Barcagenia is also the biggest producer of silver in Najha and Southern Varsemia. They also have an healthy textil business, which includes silks, cotton, linen and wool. They craftsmen are also known for their work with ivory, glass and alabaster. This solid commerce garanties economical growth even in times of war.</p>
        <p>This nation founded a religion that spread mostly through Southern Najha called Mechanism. Consisting in a politheistic pantheon of mechanical deities, with the most popular with the barcagenians being Tarnat, guardian of the barcagenian capital, Barcago, and Bahal Ahmot, her husband and god of fertility and energy. The religious cast has a notorious role in the barcagenian society, acting as advisors and tutors. These also practice sacrifices, asked by the population, that can range from animals to children, thought the sacrificed are always male. Seldomly, the priests organise great feasts in honor of the gods, where everyone dances around big pyres. Calcarian Steles are typical from this nation, erected on the grave of the fallen inside open air sanctuaries.</p>
        <p>The barcagenians have a balanced army, specialized in units that can cover a lot of territory in a short amount of time, thus they train the best scouts in the continent. Not only that, they also focus on light cavalry, light infantry, and a weapon that makes the cretian alliance shake in fear: The najhian great elephants. Thanks to Anibal's supervision, these beasts are trained for combat in any land and are known to be unstoppable, destroying everything unlucky to be on their way.</p>
        <p>On a daily life, barcagenians dress themselves with rich clothing made by their master craftsmen, mostly made of linen, with more expensive materials reserved for the wealthier population. The men own thick and well treated beards, usually adorned with various acessories, like rings. Women like to wear their hair long and braided.</p>
        <p>Diplomatically, they have a solid military alliance with the rubran. They also have good commercial relations with the same nation, from where they import tin and silver. Currently both of them are in an armed conflict known as the "First Cretian-Barcagenian conflict" against the cretian alliance, where they help the southern varsemia resistance against the cretians and directly battle the zancians in Najha.</p>
        <p>Their banner is a woman with her arms open, drawed in red and in a very simple way, on top of her, resides a green eye, observing nonstop, with a with background.</p>
        <p>Since they originally came from the mountains of Salacia, in Varsemia, they belong to the rubran culture.</p>
        <p>A typical barcagenian is 1.60m to 190m tall. Most used dark and long hair, but nobility usually wears short hair. They have dark and intense eyes. The women have light skin color, while the men a bronze color.</p>
